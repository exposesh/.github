# About

EXPOSE is your new favourite open source tool for exposing your local services on the public Internet.  
With no installation or configuration required, you can use it.  
In fact, EXPOSE relies on your SSH client.   
Authentication is done using the public SSH keys you have on your GitHub account. If you don't have any, you can [read this article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).  
So all you have to do to expose, for exemple, `localhost:3000`, is type `ssh -R 1:localhost:3000 expose.sh` in your terminal.  
If you use a different username on your computer than the one you use on GitHub, add the GitHub username to your SSH command (example: `ssh -R 1:localhost:3000 yourusername@expose.sh`).

# Use-cases

- Demos and presentations: streamlines the presentation of your applications or services by providing the capability to access them seamlessly from any device with internet connectivity
- Mobile development: run the back-end for your Android or iOS app locally and make it accessible to your app
- Webhook testing: highly beneficial for the testing and troubleshooting of webhooks, as it facilitates the exposure of a local endpoint. This makes it simple to test webhook requests from external services such as payment gateways, messaging platforms or API

# Access

To prevent malicious use of EXPOSE, you should add a star to one of the project repositories.  
Of course, if you wish, you can add stars to all the repositories. ðŸ˜„

# Free and Premium

Infrastructure is expensive, but at the same time everyone should have access to a high-performance tool of this kind.  
The free version of EXPOSE is limited to two local service exposures at a time, with a bandwidth of 100 kb/s and a maximum duration of 15 minutes per use.  
Of course, you can reconnect as often as you like.

<details>
<summary>Is it possible to generate several tunnels at once?</summary>
<strong>Yes</strong>, you can create several tunnels at once by repeating `-R `. For example: <code>ssh -R 1:localhost:port1 -R 2:localhost:port2 expose.sh</code> 
</details>

<details>
<summary>I bought a subscription but when I connect to EXPOSE, it is still the free version?</summary>
Do not panic! Check if your computer's current username matches the username of your GitHub account. If it does not, add it to your SSH command. For example: <code>ssh -R 1:localhost:port yourgithubusername@expose.sh</code>
</details>

<details>
<summary>The username matches well, but I am still on the free version of EXPOSE...</summary>
Do you have a private SSH key on your device that corresponds to a public SSH key on your GitHub account? You can find your GitHub's public SSH keys by clicking on your profile picture, then on Settings, then in the "Access" section, click on "SSH and GPG keys". Perhaps you have too many SSH keys on your device and your SSH client is getting tangled up? In that case, specify in your command where your private SSH key is located: <code>ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i /path/to/private/key -R 1:localhost:port yourgithubusername@expose.sh</code>

<details>
<summary>I see "Cannot connect to your local application. Please check your terminal for hints." in the browser!</summary>
Review the currently running SSH command for any clues, and ensure that your local application is reachable on localhost with the specified port. You can verify this accessibility by navigating to <code>http://localhost:port</code> in your browser.

<summary>How is it possible to have my SSH client automatically reconnect to EXPOSE?</summary>
It is true that disconnections are not fun... You can modify your SSH command in this way to reconnect automatically: <code>until ssh -R 1:localhost:port expose.sh; do echo Reconnecting...; done</code><br>Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive ðŸŽµðŸ˜ŒâœŠ
</details>
